The basic concept of this software is to provide a simple way to sell your **Products** through the Internet.
For the first version, I plan to implement support for **Basic Stock Management**, **Shopping Cart** and **Order Handling**.

## Basic Stock Management

To update our **Product** stocks, we have to buy a new **Batch** of this **Product** from a **Supplier**.
To verify the current amount of some **Product** available in stock, we have to consolidate the **Inventory** based on previous bought **Batches** and concluded **Selling Orders**.
